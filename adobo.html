<p>PORK ADOBO

    Filipino Pork AdoboI just recently realized that I have not shared any traditional Filipino pork adobo recipe yet. I was surprised because I grew up eating different varieties of this classic dish, some of which were Filipino Pork Adobo with Tofu and Oyster Sauce and the Chinese version: Braised Pork in Soy Sauce. Traditional Filipino adobos consist basically of garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, bay leaf, ground pepper and water. Typically, one will simmer the meat in the sauce ingredients first until the pork becomes tender. Then, they will drain and brown the meat before serving it with the sauce.
    
    WHAT IS FILIPINO ADOBO
    
    Philippine adobo is a Spanish-influenced meat dish consisting of a tangy sauce of vinegar, garlic, soy sauce and black pepper. Vinegar is a common ingredient found in many Filipino dishes and it’s one of the main ingredients in any adobo. Some may regard Adobo to be the national dish of the Philippines because it is so popular. There are so many different versions of this dish around as people have adapted this dish to their own taste.  One such variant is a more modern take that does not use soy sauce</p>
